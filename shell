difference between [ ] and [[ ]] in shell script:
1) [[ handles empty strings and strings with whitespace
    [ with this we have to quote variable to work it
2) if [[ $ANSWER = y* ]] => pattern matching
3) It has a wonderful =~ operator for doing regular expression matches. With [ you might write

if [ "$answer" = y -o "$answer" = yes ]
With [[ you can write this as

if [[ $answer =~ ^y(es)?$ ]]
