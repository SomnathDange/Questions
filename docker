Question: Difference between docker COPY and ADD command.
	https://www.ctl.io/developers/blog/post/dockerfile-add-vs-copy/

ADD: (OLD Method)
 1) The ADD instruction allows you to use a URL as the <src> parameter. 
	When a URL is provided, a file is downloaded from the URL and copied to the <dest>
	ADD http://foo.com/bar.go /tmp/main.go
	ADD http://foo.com/bar.go /tmp/
	
 2) Another feature of ADD is the ability to automatically unpack compressed files
	ADD /foo.tar.gz /tmp/
 	Problems with add: if we want to simply copy some tar fife but add will untar it inside the docker

COPY(New Method):
	1) No urls supported, that means no remote download of files
	2) Anything that you want to COPY into the container must be present in the local build  context
	3)  If you COPY an archive file it will land in the container exactly as it appears in the build context without any attempt to unpack it.

Recommendation: use COPY
